# The final project of INF01202: a Mega Man-based game: INFman

~~To compile the game, use: % gcc -o infman src/main.c $(pkg-config --static --libs raylib) -lm~~

~~Must have pkg-config and raylib installed!!~~

The above is deprecated. I'm currently refactoring all the project
structure to make it more maintainable and upgradable.
So it can be build using CMake and make.
